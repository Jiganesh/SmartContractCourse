# SmartContractCourse

Welcome to Blockchain


- Bitcoin was the first one to take blockchain mainstream
- Bitcoin is like a digital gold
- Ethereum allows for smart contracts or decentralized applications
- Chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts
- Hybrid Smart Contracts comnine on chain and off chain components

Learn about : 

Decentralized
Transperency and Flexibility
Speed and Efficiency
Security and Immutability

Trust minimized Agreements
DAO's - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations



Testnets are free and for testing smart contracts
Mainnet cost money and are considered "Live"

Faucet is an application that gives us free test tokens like free test rinkeby ethereum


Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more "gas" you have to pay for 
Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gas fee" to node operators

The amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how "computationally expensive" your transaction is 
Sending ETH to 1 address would be "cheaper" than sending ETH to 1000 addresses
